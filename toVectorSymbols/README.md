##Convert to Vector Symbols
>Converts selected bitmaps in the library to vectors, then stores them in a movieclip.

###Installing
-Each folder contains a file that should go in its respective file in your local Flash user configuration.
-The path (for a Windows user) should be something along the lines of [USER]\AppData\Local\Adobe\[Flash]\en_US\Configuration\[FolderName].
-An easy way to find this folder is to open a new Flash Javascript file in whatever version of Flash you have, then File > Save As. Flash should, by default, direct you to the user configurations folder (or one of its folders, i.e. Commands, Javascript, just go up one directory).
-Copy the files in the folders I have provided into their respective folder in your user configuration folder.
-Explicitly, "AppendLibraryNames.jsfl" should go in [USER]\AppData\Local\Adobe\[Flash]\en_US\Configuration\Javascript and "Append Library Names.jsfl" should go in [USER]\AppData\Local\Adobe\[Flash]\en_US\Configuration\Commands

###Usage
